# HazelDroid
This is an Android client to the optimized scheduling system Hazel and is a part of my groups bachelor thesis at Gothenburg University & Chalmers.
The central menu is a navigation drawer made with the new RecyclerView and the new Toolbar is used instead of the old ActionBar.

The client communicates with a specialized Haskell-server using a REST-API and JSON. This enables downloading of personnel, and schedules and uploading of new content.  To display schedules a library called Android-Week-View is used.
